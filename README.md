Piezoelectric Street Light Energy Generator
This project uses piezoelectric sensors to convert mechanical pressure from vehicles or footsteps into electrical energy. The generated energy is stored and used to power street lights, promoting energy efficiency and sustainability.

Features:

✅ Uses piezoelectric sensors to harvest energy from pressure or vibration

✅ Stores energy in a capacitor for consistent power supply

✅ Powers street lights using renewable energy

✅ Reduces dependency on conventional power sources

✅ Eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for urban lighting
